After that, I had to go back to school. I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science, which I like. I am also an AI Engineer intern, and a curriculum developer. \nI like to write poetry, short stories, and novels. I also like to write code. This is a break from the usual things I do. I am getting back to doing what I once liked. \nI hope you like my works. These are a collection I've found scattered around everywhere, in my notes, at the back of my books, stray papers. \nI do not have any social media except where you came from. \nIf I could rate myself on a scale of 1-10, I'd give myself an 8. I am not perfect, but I am working on it. \nThese poems weren't written to be perfect. They were written to be honest. If you found this page, maybe you're looking for something too. \nComing back to the facade I put in front of people, I'm a jack of all trades. We can chat about ML. I can work with LLMs. I can code in many different languages. I can solve math problems. I like organic chemistry. \nIf you know me in real life, I apologize. \nThat's it about me. Have a good day or good night, wherever you're from.`}, { id:"hair", title:"Long Long Hair", content:`When the memory of long, long hair returns, \nthere will be nowhere to find it. \nNo strands on the sheets, \nno curls clinging to old cotton. \nScent will fade from folded sheets, \nreplaced by silence \nwhere soft humming used to rest. \nUnread words, once ignored, \nring louder than expected. \nechoes in the spaces where \neyes once locked without fear. \nOld perfume drifts in the air \nand stir something unnamed. \nBut the tears of pain, quiet and constant, \nwill not be found. \nIn the scroll of old moments, \na glimpse may catch \nthe softness of long, long hair, \nbut not the one who carried it.` }, { id: "my-eyes-hear", title: "My Eyes Hear", content:`My eyes hear the sound of your voice, \nA melody that dances through the air, \nEach word a note, \nCreating a symphony beyond compare. \nYour laughter echoes in my mind, \nA sweet refrain that lingers long, \nA song that makes my spirit strong. \nIn the quiet moments, I close my eyes, \nAnd let my thoughts fill the space. \nYour words become a gentle breeze, \nA gentle pat, a warm embrace. \nMy eyes may not see the world outside, \nBut they perceive the beauty within, \nFor in your voice, I found a light, \nBefore you went and smothered it.` }, { id:"why", title:"What People Think Of Me", content:`I live in a loving home. Bless my family. I guess it's all in my head when they say all these things. Forget the outside world. Everyone thinks being loud is cool (spoiler : it is not). Everyone thinks being a jerk is cool (spoiler : it is, also, not). Seriously, why do some people behave the way they do? Is it really that bad to be a bit considerate of the people around you? \nNow I preach the stuff I don't practice. "Take deep breaths while you're crying" is what I say, but I find myself gasping for air when I cry. "Don't be so hard on yourself" is what I say, but I beat myself over things that are not supposed to affect you. \nThis is all very tiring. I'm sure you feel the same. If you're totally opposite to me, that's fine. I appreciate the outlook. If you used to be like me, I appreciate your boldness and spirit. It takes a lot to be like that. \nI am kind even when nothing works out. I have everything I want. Like I'm cleanly ripped apart by something sharp, which I cannot place. \nWhat do you feel when you see someone in their true form? Without the mask they wear? Do you feel like you know them? Do you feel like you can relate to them? Or do you feel like you're looking at a stranger? \nIt scares me when I look at someone I once clearly adored but now, feel nothing for them. How do you deal with this? It helps to think the person you saw was hypothetical, that they don't exist. Makes it easier during those sleepless nights caused by stray thoughts like these eating away at you. \nIf you want to be a better person, you don't have to do anything. Just listen to what the other person has to say. Be the change you want to see. It's all up to you. If I can do it, so can you. If you've read this till here, you and I are not so different. Both of us are looking for the same thing. Perhaps, we can find it together. \nKnow your worth. You deserve to be happy, even if it means being alone. While you can, nip whatever problem you have in the bud before it grows and becomes a parasite that feeds on your happiness. Don't let it grow. Don't let it take over yourself. \nI hope you find what you're looking for. I hope you find peace. I hope you find love. I hope you find yourself.`, }, { id:"static", title:"Drowning", content:`Falling through the static \nHearts are automatic \nNow my soul is paper thin \nAnd hurting seems the only way to feel \nPulled into the emptiness \nLost in every glimmer \nI was reaching everywhere \nBut I was the only thing that’s real` }, { id:"things-i-see", title:"The Things I See", content:`The things I see when all of my friends are \nGoing out to play \nhow can I know, you're calling me selfish \nWhen i haven't had a chance to know? \nIt seems like the end of oblivion \nWarmth of a mitten in the cold shields me from the World \nThe radio whispers - \n"oh dear, oh dear, you should stay" \nBut how can I stay when \nYou don't belong, you go astray \nAnd when i am going to be given a chance \nI would choose you over and over \nAll the feet slowly trudge out of the room \nHovering over me is everlasting gloom \nThe radio whispers - \n"Oh dear, oh dear, they were looking for you" \nI shut the door on their faces because \nThey're me, but dead a chapter in the past` }, { id:"miss-you-friend", title:"RIP", content:`Where does my heart go when you die? \nAre you right here? \nDown my face flows a tear \nLeaving behind a soft trail of fear \nI warned you, I warned you \nIf only you had listened \nSewing up myself again \nBut for how long? \nOh, didn't I tell you? \nColoured lights, shards of glass \nAll in the mind of my dear friend \nWhere did you go, will you come back? \nWhere did you go, can I tread down your track? \nSharp blades, wound ropes \nMaybe I can see you now, a pale silhouette \nI will wipe your tears, don't you worry` }, { id:"fade", title:"Fade", content:`When you say my name \nIt doesn't sound the same \nOnce in a while \nAnd you smile like before \nBut your eyes are far away \nAnd I can't reach you \nThen you turn to go \nLike you always do \nWhen you say, "I care" \nI don't believe you \nWhen I hear your song \nI still sing along \nBut when it reaches your favorite line \nI go quiet every time` },

      \nWhy don't you fall?  
      \nRight out of the sky?
      
      \nYou've lingered above me
      \nBetween the clouds and time
      \nSilhouette I can’t quite name
      \nBut I chase just the same
      
      \nSilence goes away  
      \nAnd I would bring my palms together  
      \nthat ache for memory  
      \nOr maybe just mystery.
      
      \nI would play  
      \nWith shadows on the floor  
    \nLike echoes from the door  
      \nYou never walked through.
      
      \nI would go  
      \nWith pockets full of stars  
      \nTo find where you disappeared  
      \nBetween blinking and forgetting.
      
      \nStill, every time I look  
      \nAt the moon that doesn’t speak  
      \nI wonder if it's you  
      \nWho’s holding back the sky from breaking.`,
